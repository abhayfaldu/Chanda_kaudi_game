â­•The game is similar to Pachisi and Ludo, and it is usually played on a wooden board with 5x5 or 7x7 grids.The board has a central square known as the "Chaubara," which means "four houses."

â­•The game is played with a board that has four colored squares, each with a set of four houses, and a central cross-shaped square that serves as a starting and finishing point for each player's pieces. 

â­•The game is usually played by two to four players, each of whom has four pieces or pawns that they move around the board according to the roll of a dice.

â­•The objective of the game is to move all four of your pieces from the starting point to the finishing point, using a set of dice to determine how many spaces you can move on each turn. The first player to move all of their pieces to the finishing point wins the game.
